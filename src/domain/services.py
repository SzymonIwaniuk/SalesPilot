       Allocate an order line to the first batch that can fulfill it.

       This function attempts to allocate the given order line to the earliest
       batch that has sufficient quantity available. Batches are assumed to be
       sorted by arrival time (ETA), with in-stock batches prioritized.

           str: The reference of the batch that was allocated.

       Raises:
           OutOfStock: If no batch can fulfill the order line.
